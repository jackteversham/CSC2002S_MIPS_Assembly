# MIPS Assembly Assignment

Question1.asm deals with determining the one-digit positive divisors between 1 and 10 (excluding).

Question2.asm has a loop that runs five times. Each time, a number can be entered and a result will be displayed classifying if the number is divisible by either 2 or 3, both 2 and 3 or neither 2 nor 3.

Question3.asm receives two integers and classifies both of them as relatively prime or not relatively prime. A number is relatively prime if there is no integer greater than one that divides them both.
